# YOLO-v4_OT
 The yolo-v4 object detection framework with object tracking; from a tutorial. I did change the original code from the tutorial, but the methodology used int eh tuorial was implemented extensively. However, I cannot seem to find the original tutorial to properly reference. It was a Medium/TowardsDataScience article.
